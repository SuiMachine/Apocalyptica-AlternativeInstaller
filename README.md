Apocalyptica - Alternative Installer
===========================================

An alternate installer for _Apocalyptica_, written using [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) as a replacement for original installer which has issues running on modern machines.

This project uses code from both [bgbennyboy](https://github.com/bgbennyboy)'s [_Grim Fandango Setup_](https://github.com/bgbennyboy/Grim-Fandango-Setup-and-Launcher)
and [Triangle717's](http://Triangle717.WordPress.com) **LEGO Racers installer**.
